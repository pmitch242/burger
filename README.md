# Gatta-Eat-Burgers (Burger logger)

The repo is a simple "burger logger" created with with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a self designed ORM. This repo, as well as most of my repos, follow MVC design pattern. I used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Usage 
GATTA-EAT-BURGERS! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the burger name will display on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
